    """
    Mean squared error measures the average of the square of the errors (the
    average squared difference between the estimated values and what is 
    estimated. The formula is:

    MSE = (1 / n) * \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - Yhat_i)^2

    Implement this formula here, using numpy and return the computed MSE

        targets(np.ndarray): the ground truth values

    Returns:
        MSE(int): mean squared error calculated by above equation
